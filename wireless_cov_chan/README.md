Presentation for Gatech PhD Qualifiers
This is the presentation with work done for Usenix Security 2014 submission. 
The presentation was later made using Microsoft PPT. Although I don't want to 
use Microsoft products but it seems there is just more work to be done present
the idea than it is with Powerpoint.
Learning: More importance should be given to improving the idea than trying to
improve presentation uning beamer. It is not worth the time to fix every ordinate
in graph to display a certain point.
Use the tools, not be stuck with means (tools) and miss your destination, which
is to clearly and neatly present the underlying idea.
